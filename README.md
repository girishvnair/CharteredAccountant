# CharteredAccountant
A Software for Supporting Chartered Accountants

## Chartered Accountant Web Application Documentation

 Overview
This web application is designed to support chartered accountants in managing client details, bookkeeping, payroll, and tax filings. It consists of three major modules: Client Management, Bookkeeping, and Payroll. The application is structured to be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster and handles core financial activities such as managing clients, recording transactions, categorizing data, generating payroll reports, and filing taxes.

 Modules Overview

 1. Client Management Module
- Add New Clients: Capture client information via a form and store it in a database.
- Update Existing Clients: Modify and update client details.
- Search and Retrieve Clients: Search for clients based on queries and retrieve client details.
- Manage Ongoing Engagements: Track and manage active client engagements.

 2. Bookkeeping Module
- Record Transactions: Enter transaction details and store them in the ledger.
- Categorize Transactions: Categorize transactions (e.g., Sales, Purchase, Salary) and update records.
- Integrate with Bank Feeds: Automatically import transactions from bank accounts and store them.
- Reconcile Transactions: Match book transactions with bank statements and reconcile them.

 3. Payroll Module
- Calculate Pay and Deductions: Compute salaries and applicable deductions based on input.
- Generate Payroll Reports: Generate payroll reports based on a selected date range.
- Issue Payslips: Create and send payslips to employees electronically.
- Handle Tax Filings: Manage and file payroll taxes for clients based on payroll data.

 Software Architecture

 Frontend
- Developed using Angular/React (the exact framework may depend on your preference).
- Interacts with the backend APIs to submit and retrieve data.
- Contains components for each feature like adding clients, recording transactions, generating reports, etc.

 Backend
- Developed using Express.js (Node.js framework).
- Implements APIs to manage CRUD operations for clients, transactions, payrolls, etc.
- Routes are created for each module and interact with the MongoDB database.

 Database
- MongoDB is used to store the data such as client details, financial transactions, payroll records, etc.
- The schema includes models for clients, engagements, transactions, and payrolls.

 Deployment Guide Using Kubernetes

The application is containerized using Docker, and deployment is handled by Kubernetes. Below are the steps to deploy the web application using the provided YAML configuration.

 Prerequisites:
1. A working Kubernetes cluster.
2. kubectl CLI installed and configured to interact with your Kubernetes cluster.
3. Docker installed locally to build images, or pre-built Docker images hosted in a container registry.

 Steps to Deploy the Web Application

1. Build and Push Docker Images:
   - Ensure that the Docker images for both frontend and backend are built and pushed to a Docker registry (e.g., DockerHub or any private registry).
   
   Docker Commands:
   ```bash
   # Build Docker image for the backend
   docker build -t <your-dockerhub-username>/client-management-backend:latest ./backend

   # Push the image to DockerHub
   docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/client-management-backend:latest

   # Repeat for the frontend
   docker build -t <your-dockerhub-username>/client-management-frontend:latest ./frontend
   docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/client-management-frontend:latest
   ```

2. Update Kubernetes YAML files:
   - In the provided `Deployment YAML` files, update the `image` fields to match the correct Docker image paths:
   ```yaml
   containers:
   - name: client-api
     image: <your-dockerhub-username>/client-management-backend:latest
   ```

   If you have a separate YAML file for the frontend, do the same for it.

3. Create the MongoDB Database:
   - Deploy MongoDB to your Kubernetes cluster or connect to an existing MongoDB instance.
   - If you need to deploy MongoDB within the Kubernetes cluster, you can use a ready-to-deploy YAML configuration or use Helm for easier deployment.
   Example Helm command:
   ```bash
   helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
   helm install mongodb bitnami/mongodb
   ```

4. Apply the Kubernetes Deployment Files:
   - Once the images are built and pushed, apply the YAML files to deploy the application to your Kubernetes cluster.
   
   Run the following command:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```
   - If you have multiple YAML files for different services (backend, frontend, MongoDB, etc.), apply them sequentially:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f backend-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f frontend-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f mongodb-deployment.yaml
   ```

5. Expose Services (Optional):
   - Depending on the nature of your cluster, you may want to expose the services externally using `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`. Update the `Service` configuration accordingly.
   
   Example:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: client-management-service
   spec:
     type: LoadBalancer
     ports:
     - port: 3000
       targetPort: 3000
     selector:
       app: client-management
   ```

6. Monitor the Deployment:
   - You can monitor the deployment status by running:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   kubectl get services
   ```
   - Ensure that the pods are running and that the services are exposed correctly.

---

 Testing and Verification

Once the application is deployed:
1. Access the Frontend:
   - If the frontend is exposed via a service, you can access it via the external IP or port assigned to it (for `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort`).
   
   Example:
   ```
   http://<external-ip>:<port>
   ```

2. Verify Backend API:
   - You can test the backend APIs using tools like Postman or `curl` by sending requests to the backend endpoints exposed by the service.

3. Database Connection:
   - Ensure that the backend APIs are connected to MongoDB, and all data operations (inserting, updating, and fetching clients, transactions, payrolls) are functioning as expected.
